# Problem Statement
1. Predict the S&P for the next:
- next day
- next month
2. Create a platform that will alert me to:
- drops in prices
- when prediction shows a downward trend

# Possible Steps
1. Build a API query bot
2. Usage of traditional (S)ARIMA to predict the model
3. See if other data can enrich the predictions
4. Build monitoring
